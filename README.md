**Thoughtlog** is an app where users/developers/entrepreneurs can utilise and be more productive in developing a project. A project could be a new app, a goal, or a place to just to throw your thought process. Users can start by creating a project. This project will then have a **thoughts timeline**, where all the thought process goes in.
